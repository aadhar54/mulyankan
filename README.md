## What is it ?
Easy to use, modern solution to checking exam papers online. In recent times, due to the Coronavirus outbreak, heroes like the police, doctors and teachers are working hard to help the nation. This is my contribution to help the teachers out!

&nbsp;&nbsp;

## What's it for ?
I made this app as teachers face many problems when checking students' exam papers online. These are in PDF format and there are a lot of PDF editors out there! But they are mostly paid or too hard to use. I made this app tailored to a teachers need. You can check the paper using an easy drag and drop interface!

&nbsp;&nbsp;

## How to use it ?
You can simply go to <a href="https://mulyankan.netlify.app">this link</a>, upload a students PDF file and get started with the checking! It's very intuitive and you can add ticks, crosses, marks and everything you might need to check a paper. You can also download it as a PDF or save it as a JSON file and continue working on it later.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Why should I use it ?
&nbsp;
- **Easy and Intuitive drag and drop interface:** _Who ever said checking papers online has to be harder than real life ?
_
- **Add ‚úÖ  ,  ‚ùå  , üíØ:** _Never compromise with a student. Point their mistakes and appreciate their efforts with essential symbols_
- **Download Checked PDF:** _Yep! You can open, edit and Download the PDF - all for free!_
- **Save and Work Later:** _Who knows, maybe your kid fell down or you gotta go get coffee.. No worries, you can save your work as JSON and work on it later - Just like nothing happened!_
- **Copy and Paste:** _Damn that textbox is just too hard to reach. You know what, just copy the one above and scooch it over here!_
- **Undo and Redo:** _Oppsie doodle! Looks like you made a mistake. Well, time travel isn't possible but maybe if you could undo you mistake.. Well you can.._

&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Well.. I want that one feature you don't have..
No problemo! Just open an issue and I'll try my best to implement it as soon as possible!
